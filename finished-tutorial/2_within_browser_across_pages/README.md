# Step 2: within browser across pages
This step has a _streamer.html_ page that represents a streamer and an _index.html_ page that represents a viewer.

## Running this step
To get this step running, you need to host the HTML scripts. To host the HTML scripts, run this command in _2_within_browser_across_pages_ directory:
```bash
npx serve .
```

After running the command, open the URL hosting the files in your browser. For the web application to function correctly, you need to open these two pages in the same browser.
