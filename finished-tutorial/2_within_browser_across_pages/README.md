# Running this project

*cd* into this directory and run `npx serve .`. When you run this command, it will tell you which URL is hosting the project.

After running the command, open the URL in your browser to see the web app.

This directory has a _streamer.html_ page that represents the streamer, and an _index.html_ page that represents the viewer. You need to open these two pages in the same browser for the application to work.
