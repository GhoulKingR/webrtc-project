# Step 2: within browser across pages
In this step, there are two essential files: _index.html_ and _streamer.html_.

_streamer.html_ represents a streamer and _index.html_ represents a viewer. _streamer.html_ allows a user to create a live broadcast that another user can view with the _client.html_ page.

## Running this step
To get this step running, you need to host the HTML scripts. To host the HTML scripts, run this command in _2_within_browser_across_pages_ directory:
```bash
npx serve .
```

After running the command, open the URL hosting the files in your browser. For the web application to function correctly, you need to open these two pages in the same browser.
